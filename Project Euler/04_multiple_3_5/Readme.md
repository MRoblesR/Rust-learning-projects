# Multiples of 3 or 5
This problem is stated on https://projecteuler.net/problem=1

The code does nothing crazy. It just sums the difference between each multiple instead of using the modulus. This difference repeats every 7 numbers, consider it between 3 and 15. 
1. Between 0 and 3 there are 3 units.
2. Between 3 and 5 there are 2 units.
3. Between 5 and 6 there is 1 units.
4. Between 6 and 9 there are 3 units.
5. Between 9 and 10 there is 1 units.
6. Between 10 and 12 there are 3 units.
7. Between 12 and 15 there are 3 units.
