# Prime Number Generator

This project implements a basic prime number generator in Rust. It is based on the concept that most primes can be expressed as either 6n + 1 or 6n - 1, where n is a natural number, to efficiently generate primes up to a specified limit.

This program shows me the performance benefits of Rust. Generating one million prime numbers takes approximately 6 seconds. For comparison, a similar implementation in Python 3.11 took roughly 120 seconds.
