I dove into Project Euler's problem #3 (https://projecteuler.net/problem=3) and started coding my own solution.  While exploring, I came across the primes crate after searching for "Rust prime struct", which solved this challenge directly. This highlights the useful ecosystem of Rust libraries â€“ there's likely a well-established crate for many tasks you encounter.

In this case, using the primes crate might be the most efficient approach. However, I'm also considering implementing my own solution to solidify my understanding of Rust concepts.
